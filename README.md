# What makes a great Quality Assurance (QA) Analyst? A Four-Year Survey in Brazilian companies

## Study Context

This repository accompanies the study *"What makes a great Quality Assurance (QA) Analyst? A Four-Year Survey in Brazilian Companies"*, presented at SBES 2025. The work explores the evolving profile, skills, and activities of QA professionals based on data collected from 169 participants between 2021 and 2025. It investigates both technical and behavioral competencies expected of QA professionals, providing insight into the Brazilian software testing landscape and contributing to the understanding of how QA roles have evolved over time.

## Data Provenance

Data was collected through an anonymous online questionnaire distributed via professional networks, social media, and email campaigns. The instrument followed survey design best practices (Kasunic; Kitchenham & Pfleeger) and underwent pilot testing with 54 professionals to ensure clarity and validity. Responses were gathered from QA professionals across Brazil, working at different career levels (junior, mid-level, senior) and in various regions and organization sizes.

## Ethical and Legal Statements

Participation in the study was voluntary and anonymous. No personal identifiers were collected. The questionnaire included a consent form, and all data was analyzed in aggregate form to ensure participant privacy and data integrity.
